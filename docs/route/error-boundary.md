# `ErrorBoundary`

An `ErrorBoundary` is a React component that renders whenever anything is thrown anywhere on the route, either during rendering or during data loading. This can be a thrown `Response`/`Error` from a loader/action or an `Error` thrown during rendering. This `ErrorBoundary` is an implementation of the React Router []`errorElement`/`ErrorBoundary`][rr-error-boundary].
